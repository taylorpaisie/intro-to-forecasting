## Why scenarios?

Stakeholders often don't want *one* future—they want **choices**. Scenarios let you explore "what if?" without building separate models.

### The three scenarios

Each scenario is built from the **same baseline forecast** with different assumptions:

- **Nominal (base case):** Best estimate using historical trend + known commitments
  - Example: "$2M baseline, trending up 5% YoY"
- **Optimistic:** Favorable assumptions (higher success rates, faster ramp, better execution)
  - Example: "$2.4M if we land the Q2 pipeline deals + improve execution to 92%"
- **Pessimistic:** Risk assumptions (slower execution, lost deals, market headwinds)
  - Example: "$1.6M if we lose a major vendor or hit market slowdown"

**Key rule:** All scenarios must use the same historical data and same evaluation period, so they're apples-to-apples comparable.

## Communication patterns that work

- **Show a forecast band:** Use an 80% prediction interval (10th to 90th percentile). This is tighter than 95% but still captures most scenarios.
- **Label clearly:** "Forecast" vs. "High scenario" vs. "Low scenario" — avoid vague terms like "upside."
- **Track changes:** Add a "What changed since last month?" section (new data? new assumptions? model tweak?).
- **Document assumptions:** List drivers in plain English (e.g., "assumes 90% vendor performance, Q2 pipeline close rate 40%, no new budget cuts").
- **Keep it consistent:** Nominate one person per forecasting cycle to ensure same assumptions across all forecasts.
