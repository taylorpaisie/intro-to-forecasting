title: "03 — Scenarios + communication"

## Why scenarios?

Stakeholders often don’t want *one* future—they want **choices**.

We’ll create:
- **Nominal**: best estimate
- **Optimistic**: lower execution / favorable assumptions
- **Pessimistic**: higher execution / risk assumptions

## Communication patterns that work

- Show a forecast band (e.g., 80% interval) and label it clearly.
- Add a short “What changed since last month?” section.
- Include assumptions (drivers) in plain English.
